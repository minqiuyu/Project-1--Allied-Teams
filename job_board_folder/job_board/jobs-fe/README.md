# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Note that Github does not push node packages with React projects; to run this project locally, you need to run the command "npm install" in your terminal while it's active in this folder. Start the React application with "npm start" once you're done.
